To-Do List App

Project Overview
This is a simple To-Do List web application that helps users add, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, meaning they persist even after the page is refreshed.

Technologies Used
HTML – Provides the structure of the web page.
CSS – Styles the app to make it visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript – Adds interactivity and handles task management.
LocalStorage – Saves tasks so they remain after refreshing the page.
Google Fonts – Uses the "Poppins" font for better typography.
Project Structure
The project consists of three main files:
📂 index.html – The main webpage structure.
🎨 styles.css – The styles and layout of the app.
⚙️ script.js – The logic that controls task functionality.

This project is a great starting point for learning frontend web development. It:
✅ Demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.
